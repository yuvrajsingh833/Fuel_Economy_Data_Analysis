# Conclusions ðŸ’¡
Answering two questions about the dataset

## Questions asked ðŸ¤”:
### _**Question 1**_: Are more unique car models using alternative fuels in 2018 compared to 2008? By how much?
In 2008 we had 984 unique car models using gasoline, we had also one car model for ethanol, CNG and gas respectively. However, in 2018 we have 749 unique models which its fuel is gasoline and _**26**_ unique models for Gas, _**26**_ unique models for Ethanol, _**19**_ for Diesel and _**12**_ Unique Models for Electric Cars

In terms of proportions, we can see a dramatic change in the manufacture of Cars using alternative fuels. It has increased from _**0.53%**_ in 2008 to _**7.3%**_ which would be an increment of _**1284.62%**_ in 10 years.

### _**Question 2**_: How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy (increased in miles per gallon ("mpg"))?
The higher a car's MPG, the more fuel efficient it is. We can see in the image below that Large Cars has increased mpg by _**4.9**_, midsize car by _**6.28**_, minivan by _**1.68**_, pickup by _**2.31**_, small cars by _**4.31**_ and station wagon by _**5.16**_
