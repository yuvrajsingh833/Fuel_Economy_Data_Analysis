# Fuel Economy Data Analysis 📊
## Project Description:
Data Analysis with Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib 📈 about a fuel economy data 💸 from US car models 🚗 from 2008 and 2018

## Reason we're studying this dataset:
I have some questions regarding greenhouse effect 🌳 and how the cars are related to this effect, therefore I created this 3 questions:

_**Q1**_: Are more unique models using _**alternative fuels**_ in 2018 compared to 2008? By how much 🤨?

_**Q2**_: How much have vehicle classes improved in _**fuel economy**_ 📉 (increased in miles per gallon)?

_**Q3**_: For all of the models that were produced in 2008 that are still being produced now, how much has the _**miles per gallon improved and which vehicle improved the most 🚗**_?

### _**Step 2:**_ Data Cleansing 🧹:
[Click Here](https://github.com/davidtc8/Fuel_Economy_Data_Analysis/tree/master/Cleaning%20Columns%20Labels) if you want to know more about how to _**clean data**_, this is a highly demand skill, because you will always encounter _**data quality issues**_.

### _**Step 3:**_ Fixing Datatypes 🔨:
[Click Here](https://github.com/davidtc8/Fuel_Economy_Data_Analysis/tree/master/Fixing%20Data%20Types) if you want to know more about how to _**fix datatypes**_ using Jupyter Notebook.

### _**Step 4:**_ Exploring your data using visualizations 📈:
[Click Here](https://github.com/davidtc8/Fuel_Economy_Data_Analysis/tree/master/Exploring%20with%20visuals) if you want to know how to create _**visualizations using matplotlib**_.

### _**Step 5:**_ Conclusions 💡:
[Click Here](https://github.com/davidtc8/Fuel_Economy_Data_Analysis/tree/master/Conclussions%20and%20Visuals) if you want to know what were the answers to the questions proposed to this project.

### _**Additional Step:**_ Merging data frames to answer more questions 🔄:
[Click Here](https://github.com/davidtc8/Fuel_Economy_Data_Analysis/tree/master/Merging%20Datasets) if you want to know the importance of merging datasets together and review the last question of this project to know _**which car was the most fuel efficient in the United States in 2018.**_
