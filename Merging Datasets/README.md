# Merging Data frames in Pandas ðŸ”„
How to merge two datasets to make even further analysis. 

## Why is it important ðŸ¤¨:
Youâ€™d have probably encountered multiple data tables that have various bits of information that you would like to see all in one place â€” one dataframe in this case. And this is where the _**power of merge**_ comes in to efficiently combine multiple data tables together in a nice and orderly fashion into a single dataframe for further analysis.

## Questions asked ðŸ¤”:
### _**Question 1**_: For all of the models that were produced in 2008 that are still being produced now, how much has the mpg improved and which vehicle improved the most?
Once that we have merged the data into a single dataframe, we can answer this question.

We can see that the best car from the whole dataset would be the _**Volvo XC 90**_ which has improved the most throghout the years in terms of fuel efficiency!
