Identifying correlation between different variables in the dataset.

## What is Matplotlib in Python?
Natplotlib is a python library. Matplotlib is a 2D plot library that produces good quality figures, although it has it origin in emulating the MATLAB graphics commands, it is independent of Matlab, matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter and histogram. In summary, plots help us in order to understand trends, patterns and to make a correlation.

## Insights:
### Correlation between _**Car Displacement**_ and _**Miles per Galon**_ from 2008 to 2018: 
According to the data analysis, there is a _**negative correlation**_ between **car displacement** and **miles per galon** for both years.

### Correlation between _**Greenhouse Gas Score**_ and _**Miles per Galon**_ from 2008 to 2018: 
However, when analyzing the relationship between this two variables, we can see that there is a _**strong positive relationship**_ between this two variables.
