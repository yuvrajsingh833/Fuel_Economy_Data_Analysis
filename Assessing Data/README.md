# Assessing Data 🔍
## What is data assessment?
In a perfect world, data would always be complete, accurate, current, pertinent, and unambiguous. In the real world, data is generally flawed on some or all of these dimensions. Data assessment in practice has tended to focus on completeness and accuracy, and that is the focus of this exercise.
## Analysis:
Analysing the data as 2 different dataframes, checking the data types we have for each value, also evaluating the duplicate rows, missing values, unique values in each of the datasets
