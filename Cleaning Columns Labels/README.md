# Cleansing Process ðŸ§¹
## What is data cleansing?
According to **Tableau**, when using data, most people agree that your insights and analysis are only as good as the data you are using. Essentially, garbage data in is garbage analysis out. Data cleaning, also referred to as data cleansing and data scrubbing, is one of the most important steps for your organization if you want to create a culture around quality data decision-making.
## Analysis:
Eliminate columns that didn't make sense in the data, rename columns, replace spaces with underscores and lowecase labels for a better data management, making sure the two datasets have equal labels for further data analysis.
